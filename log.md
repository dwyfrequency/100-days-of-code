# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished FCC Responsive Web Design Section | Completed Personal Portfolio Webpage: added form to contact me at the bottom of the page and added the icons to link to my social media. 

**Thoughts:** Getting better with using media queries and flexbox. I was a little rusty on my forms. I should start doing more practice with them. 

**Link to work:** [Completed Personal Portfolio Webpage](https://codepen.io/jdwy215/pen/dmKmWZ)

### Day 0: April 10, 2018 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Started Wes Bos's Grid Course. Downloaded/configured Visual Studios to use WSL, installed node, general config

**Thoughts**: Finished all the configGrid is going to be a challenge. Looking forward to working more with it. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Config Setup for Grid](https://github.com/dwyfrequency/css-grid-1/blob/master/02%20-%20Starter%20Files%20and%20Tooling%20Setup/test-START.html)


### Day 1: April 11, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges

**Thoughts** I saved the toughest for last. Looks like it's an 80 20, 80% of my time will be spent on 20% of the problems. I spent a decent bit of time on the [Telephone Number Validator](https://beta.freecodecamp.org/en/challenges/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/telephone-number-validator), but couldnt complete it

### Day 1: April 11, 2018 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Working through the beginning of Wes Bos's Grid Course 

**Thoughts** Hammering the fundamentals! Looking forward to building some cool projects with grid. Interested to see how flex box and grid work together

### Day 2: April 12, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

**Thoughts** This was a mind bending amount of regex. I'll definitely have to review the solutions and see how else it could be accomplished. I spent longer than I'd like to admit on this.

1. [Telephone Number Validator](https://beta.freecodecamp.org/en/challenges/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/telephone-number-validator)

### Day 3: April 13, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Spent Time Reviewing Regex & Working on Grid Course

**Thoughts** Jeez regex can be tricky - going to need to spend a bit more time with it. In other news, the grid course is picking up.

### Day 4: April 14, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Completed Caesar Cipher 

**Thoughts** Hit some roadblocks, but ultimately completed it. I found that writing out notes on paper and trying to understand the wrap around helped. Thank you modulo operator. I'll have to spend more time understanding when to use it. It's very helpful and applicable to multiple algos

### Day 5: April 14, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Mostly Focussed on Dom Manipulation 

**Thoughts** Really interesting to see my js actually change the content and layout of a website. Once I finish the fundamentals, I'll return to the grid course. I took a slight detour back to udemy because the grid course was going to use some dom stuff. 
Takeaways: not sure why you would use other selectors except for querySelector and querySelectorAll.

### Day 6: April 14, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Finished FCC Challenge Smallest Common Multiple

**Thoughts** Need to refactor - my solution can be improved.

### Day 6: April 14, 2018 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Colt's Dom Manipulation Section

**Thoughts** Oh boy, I got caught in a time suck involving this and arrow syntax. I still dont fully get it so more reasearch to come.

### Day 7: April 14, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Colt's Dom Manipulation Section

**Thoughts** this in js is pretty dang confusing - going to have to look more into lexical scope
