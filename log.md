# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 10, 2018 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Finished FCC Responsive Web Design Section | Completed Personal Portfolio Webpage: added form to contact me at the bottom of the page and added the icons to link to my social media. 

**Thoughts:** Getting better with using media queries and flexbox. I was a little rusty on my forms. I should start doing more practice with them.

### Day 0: April 10, 2018 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Started Wes Bos's Grid Course. Downloaded/configured Visual Studios to use WSL, installed node, general config

**Thoughts**: Finished all the configGrid is going to be a challenge. Looking forward to working more with it.

### Day 1: April 11, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges

**Thoughts** I saved the toughest for last. Looks like it's an 80 20, 80% of my time will be spent on 20% of the problems. I spent a decent bit of time on the [Telephone Number Validator](https://beta.freecodecamp.org/en/challenges/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/telephone-number-validator), but couldnt complete it

### Day 1: April 11, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Working through the beginning of Wes Bos's Grid Course 

**Thoughts** Hammering the fundamentals! Looking forward to building some cool projects with grid. Interested to see how flex box and grid work together
