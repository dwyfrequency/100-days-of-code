# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished FCC Responsive Web Design Section | Completed Personal Portfolio Webpage: added form to contact me at the bottom of the page and added the icons to link to my social media. 

**Thoughts:** Getting better with using media queries and flexbox. I was a little rusty on my forms. I should start doing more practice with them. 

**Link to work:** [Completed Personal Portfolio Webpage](https://codepen.io/jdwy215/pen/dmKmWZ)

### Day 0: April 10, 2018 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Started Wes Bos's Grid Course. Downloaded/configured Visual Studios to use WSL, installed node, general config

**Thoughts**: Finished all the configGrid is going to be a challenge. Looking forward to working more with it. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Config Setup for Grid](https://github.com/dwyfrequency/css-grid-1/blob/master/02%20-%20Starter%20Files%20and%20Tooling%20Setup/test-START.html)


### Day 1: April 11, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges

**Thoughts** I saved the toughest for last. Looks like it's an 80 20, 80% of my time will be spent on 20% of the problems. I spent a decent bit of time on the [Telephone Number Validator](https://beta.freecodecamp.org/en/challenges/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/telephone-number-validator), but couldnt complete it

### Day 1: April 11, 2018 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Working through the beginning of Wes Bos's Grid Course 

**Thoughts** Hammering the fundamentals! Looking forward to building some cool projects with grid. Interested to see how flex box and grid work together

1. [Grid Repo](https://github.com/dwyfrequency/css-grid-1)

### Day 2: April 12, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

**Thoughts** This was a mind bending amount of regex. I'll definitely have to review the solutions and see how else it could be accomplished. I spent longer than I'd like to admit on this.

1. [Telephone Number Validator](https://beta.freecodecamp.org/en/challenges/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/telephone-number-validator)

### Day 3: April 13, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Spent Time Reviewing Regex & Working on Grid Course

**Thoughts** Jeez regex can be tricky - going to need to spend a bit more time with it. In other news, the grid course is picking up. 

1. [Grid Span Cardio](https://github.com/dwyfrequency/css-grid-1/tree/master/11%20-%20Spanning%20and%20Placing%20Cardio)

### Day 4: April 14, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Completed Caesar Cipher 

**Thoughts** Hit some roadblocks, but ultimately completed it. I found that writing out notes on paper and trying to understand the wrap around helped. Thank you modulo operator. I'll have to spend more time understanding when to use it. It's very helpful and applicable to multiple algos  

1. [Caesar Cipher](https://beta.freecodecamp.org/en/challenges/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/caesars-cipher)

### Day 5: April 15, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Mostly Focussed on Dom Manipulation 

**Thoughts** Really interesting to see my js actually change the content and layout of a website. Once I finish the fundamentals, I'll return to the grid course. I took a slight detour back to udemy because the grid course was going to use some dom stuff. 
Takeaways: not sure why you would use other selectors except for querySelector and querySelectorAll.

### Day 6: April 16, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Finished FCC Challenge Smallest Common Multiple

**Thoughts** Need to refactor - my solution can be improved.

### Day 7: April 17, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Colt's Dom Manipulation Section

### Day 12: April 22, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: 
- Working on Wes Bos's grid course
- Finished up Advanced DOM Manipulation on Colt's Udemy Course

**Thoughts** Didn't feel as productive today. That being said learned a lot about events in js. Using classlist to add and remove classes for elements is super useful. 
Wes - Good to start building some websites again even if i am just following along. The power of grid is definitely evident.

**Today's Progress**: 
- Still working on Wes Bos's grid course

### Day 15: April 25, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: 
- Forgot to work on the grid course and spent most of my time with npm and how to get started with node.
- The work today was mostly in FCC 

**Thoughts** Finding where to use grid and where to use flexbox. They seem pretty interchangable 

1. [npm] (https://beta.freecodecamp.org/en/challenges/managing-packages-with-npm/remove-a-package-from-your-dependencies)

### Day 16: April 26, 2018 (Example 1)

**Thoughts** Need to use width 100% to get your image to play nice in your grid. Placing text on top of your image can be hard. You will need to decide between loading the image via css background: url or the img html tag. The latter is more accessible, but can be  more annoying to work with.
